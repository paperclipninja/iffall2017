Looks good for the most part, consider changing typeface?
text obscures image a lot, inconsistant format
images look good though, high quality

Things to think about: Scaling (how is image/text going to change)
				Image and text relationship-legibility vs seeing the image, how to balance
				consistant format-what do you want the default layout to look like?
