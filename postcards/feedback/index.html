				Aesthetic: Pixelated image for first, inconsistent aesthetic-solid background, textured background, and screen grab
				Legible on larger scale
				type looks fine to me

				Structure: visual priority is image
					foreground: text. background: image

					Consider how inbetween steps are gonna work

				technical challenges:	How is stuff gonna work in between? lots of position shifting (ie browser is top left and mobile is bottom right)

				image resolution!
				fonts are fine
