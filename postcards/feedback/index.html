				Aesthetic: Pixelated image for first, inconsistent aesthetic-solid background, textured background, and screen grab<br>
				Legible on larger scale<br>
				type looks fine to me<br>
<br>
				Structure: visual priority is image<br>
					foreground: text. background: image<br>
<br>
					Consider how inbetween steps are gonna work<br>
<br>
				technical challenges:	How is stuff gonna work in between? lots of position shifting (ie browser is top left and mobile is bottom right)<br>
<br>
				image resolution!<br>
				fonts are fine<br>
